# Livepeer NodeJS

Livepeer API wrapper for Node projects, supporting for streams and sessions.

The **Stream** is the core building block of the livepeer.com platform. A livepeer.com stream is a unique object with configuration data and metadata about all live stream sessions associated with it.

The **Session** is a single live streaming session. It is an especially important Livepeer.com API object if need to reference recorded live stream sessions.

This library is intended to provide Livepeer API convenience methods for applications written in server-side Javascript.
Please note that this package uses Livepeer API keys and is intended to be used in server-side code only.

## Documentation

See the [Livepeer docs](https://livepeer.org/docs)

## Installation

```
npm install livepeer-nodejs --save
```

or

```
yarn add livepeer-nodejs
```

## Usage

To start, you will need to get API key for Livepeer. For more information on where to get an API key, visit https://livepeer.com/app/user/keys 


Require the `livepeer-nodejs` npm module and create a Livepeer instance. Your Livepeer instance will have some properties such as Stream and Session that allow you to access the Stream and Session APIs.

```javascript
const Livepeer = require('livepeer-nodejs');
const livepeerObject = new Livepeer({api_key});
```

### Stream

The **stream** is the core building block of the livepeer.com platform. A livepeer.com stream is a unique object with configuration data and metadata about all live stream sessions associated with it.

| Property  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| name  | Additional identifier for the asset. Often set to a human readable string. This identifier does not need to be unique  |
| profiles  | Transcoding rendition settings. The source will be delivered with the renditions in the HLS and does not need to be redefined in the profiles parameter. If no profiles are defined, only the source will be delivered for playback  |
| id  | Unique identifier for the stream.   |
| createdAt  | Timestamp when the asset was created. Reported in Unix epoch time.   |
| streamKey  | Unique secret key used to form the RTMP ingest URL. ex: RTMP ingest URL - rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.com/live  |
| playbackId  | Unique identifier used to form the playback URL. ex: Playback URL - https://cdn.livepeer.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8   |
| ...  | Other object keys.  |

#### - Create a stream

Create a stream with name and profiles.

```javascript
const stream = await livepeerObject.Stream.create(
    {
    "name": "test_stream", 
    "profiles": [
        {
            "name": "720p",
            "bitrate": 2000000,
            "fps": 30,
            "width": 1280,
            "height": 720
        },
        {
            "name": "480p",
            "bitrate": 1000000,
            "fps": 30,
            "width": 854,
            "height": 480
        },
        {
            "name": "360p",
            "bitrate": 500000,
            "fps": 30,
            "width": 640,
            "height": 360
        },
    ]
    }
);
```

#### - Retrieve all streams

Get all streams with the same user (owner of the api_key)

```javascript
const streams = await livepeerObject.Stream.getAll(streamOnly = 0, isActive = false, record = false);
```
| Parameter  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| streamOnly | If 1, exclude historic stream objects |
| isActive | If true, get only active stream |
| record | If true, get only recorded on stream |

#### - Retrieve a stream using id

```javascript
const stream = await livepeerObject.Stream.get(id);
```

#### - Turn on/off recording

Turn on/off recording for streams, but not for session or historic stream object (representing a single live stream)

```javascript
const stream = await livepeerObject.Stream.get(id);
const result = await stream.setRecord(true / false);
```

#### - Retrieve a list of sessions

Retrieve a list of sessions of a stream.

```javascript
const stream = await livepeerObject.Stream.get(id);
const sessions = await stream.getSessions(true / false);
```

set param as true to get recorded session, otherwise false

### Session

The **session** is a single live streaming session. It is an especially important Livepeer.com API object if need to reference recorded live stream sessions.

| Property  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| id | Unique identifier for the session. |
| sourceSegmentsDuration | Duration in seconds of session source processed. |
| record | True means the session is being recorded or was recorded. False means session is not being recorded or was not recorded. |
| parentId | Points to a parent stream object. The session’s parentId is the same string as its parent stream’s id. |
| recordingStatus | Appears only if record is true. It is either ready when the recorded live stream is available for playback or waiting while the livestream is still active or just recently completed. |
| recordingUrl | Appears only if record is true when recordingStatus changes to ready. It’s value is the .m3u8 URL to stream the recorded session |
| ... | Other object keys |

#### - Retrieve a list of sessions

Retrieve a list of sessions with the same User (owner of the api_key).

```javascript
const sessions = await livepeerObject.Session.getAll();
```

#### - Retrieve a session from session id

```javascript
const session = await livepeerObject.Session.get(id);
```

### Ingest

Get references to stream ingest data centers on the Livepeer network.

| Property  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| base | Base URL for the playback URL |
| ingest | Base URL used to configure the broadcast software. Pair it with a stream object streamKey |
| playback | Base URL for HLS playback. Append a stream object playbackId to create the full playback URL |

#### - Get closest ingest

```javascript
const ingest = await livepeerObject.Ingest.getClosest()
```

#### - Get all ingests

```javascript
const ingests = await livepeerObject.Ingest.getAll()
```
